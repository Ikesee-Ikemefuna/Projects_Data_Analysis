# Projects_Data_Analysis


Business Requirement - I carried out series of tasks below to provide useful reports to aid decision making. 

My analysis was carried out using pivot tables/dashboard and other advanced excel functions, Power_BI functions and visuals, and SQL queries/Tables. The Excel, PowerBI and SQL contain all the rough work/pivot tables/Dashboards about the business requirements. 

#Excel
1.	What is the yearly profit made by the company. Plot this on an appropriate chart.

2.	Which product category is driving profit the most for the company?

3.	Which region contributes the most profit for the company. 

4.	Which customer segment is most profitable? 

5.	What is the Minimum, Maximum, Median, Mode and Mean (average) number of days to ship an order.

6.	Which order priority generates the most revenue(sales)?

7.	How many critical orders were shipped longer than the average number of days to ship.

8.	Which region has the highest number of critical orders that were shipped longer than the average days to ship.

9.	Which manager is responsible for the highest number of critical orders that were shipped longer than the average days to ship.

10.	Show a trend of revenue based on the day of the week. Which weekday generates the highest and least revenue? Assignment

11.	Which Shipping mode cost the most and by how much?

12.	Which customer age group drives the most profit for the company?

13.	The management is so interested in understanding drivers of returned orders.
Which product category, age band, region, manager and order status is this predominant to? 

Based on data we have, show the correlation between number of days to ship and returned items. Could this be the major reason?

14.	How much revenue was lost due to the returned products? 

15.	Make some recommendations on how we can prevent the high rate of returned items. 

16.	What will be the commercial value if rate of returned orders  decline by 50% after 6 months?

17.	The management intends to promote one of the regional managers to become Head of Sales of the company, based on important key performance indicators, who will you recommend and why?


#PowerBI
The are the business requirements to get using PowerBI:

1) Total Order
2) Total Sales
3) Total Profit
4) Yearly Profit
5) Monthly profit
6) Weekly proffit
7) Profit by Region 
8) Profit by Product Category
9) Profit by Regional Manager

#SQL
The SQL business requirement is on the committed SQL file, right above each query on the file. Please run the queries if you want to visualize the tables.

Presentation and Recommendation 
I created a slide deck (ppt/presentation/pack) based on the output of the analysis, plot the results on the appropriate graphs/charts and made commentaries/recommendations based on my findings. 
I used Pictures, clip art, Shapes including call out buttons etc to communicate my insights.
